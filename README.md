This plugin logs the following actions to a text file:

- Shooting item frames and armor stands with a projectile
- Players nearby when a creeper explodes
- Removal of books from lecterns
- Mounting of horses
- Naming of entities via nametag

You can toggle these via config.yml.

This isn't a polished CoreProtect or Prism extension, it's a simple personal plugin I've made public for those who are interested.
